# Simple_LSTM_Implementation

One of the most basic and effective implementation of LSTMs for training a predictive model based on past or current hour data.
Prediction model is trained to predict the next hour sales of liquor sales shop.
Dataset file is available(LiquorSales.csv).

### Prerequisites
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* datetime
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow

## Working DEMO

Jupyter notebook(simple_LSTM_implementation.ipynb) is included which contains:
* Reading LiquorSales.csv data file.
* Creating model architecture.
* Training the model.
* Plotting the loss curve.
* Predicting using trained model.

### Note
Run (simple_LSTM_implementation.ipynb) notebook on jupyter-notebook or jupyter-lab for best visualization.
